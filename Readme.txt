This project went better than the last one. It made it very clear how useful factory and command patterns are. They made adding features and testing much easier

Again I left comments marked Trey: at key points and the patterns used. 

Hot key are as follows (Tool tips on hover as well):
S: Select
C: Clone Element
M: Move Selected
F: Scale
N: new
O: open
P: save
E: Export
D: delete
U: undo
R: redo
B: Set Background
